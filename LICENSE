I'm trying to figure out the license right now.  Currently, some of the code is from a GPL project,
so until I get permission, this has to be GPLd, but eventually it will have to be MIT or LGPL.  If 
neccesary, I will rewrite the borrowed code to make that happen.

Current (temporary) license:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt
