Objective Git
===================

This is a implementation of Git in Objective-C, for embedding in Cocoa
and iPhone applications.

Initially, it is meant to provide basic read and write access to loose 
and packed objects, and to provide an input stream handler that can negotiate 
the server side of the git client/server protocol.


Credits
===================
A bit of this code is borrowed from the Git.git project and the NSData 
compression stuff was borrowed from the Etoile framework.
